# AWS-SERVERLESS-DEPLOYMENT

In this project, I utilized a range of AWS services to create a fully scalable, secure, and cost-effective web application:

🔹📦 𝗦𝟯: Hosted the static content (HTML, CSS, JS) with high availability and durability.

🔹🚪 𝗔𝗣𝗜 𝗚𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘄𝗮𝘆: Used as entry point for any API requests, which handled traffic securely while allowing integrating to the corresponding backend services.

🔹 λ 𝗟𝗮𝗺𝗯𝗱𝗮: Provided serverless compute, executing backend code in response to API requests without the need to manage servers.

🔹🗄️𝗗𝘆𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗼𝗗𝗕: Provided fast, flexible NoSQL database services to handle data for the application with minimum latency.

🔹🌐 𝗖𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁: Delivered static content worldwide with low latency as part of its content delivery network, or CDN.

Combined, these services helped make the application highly performant, secure, and scalable. The serverless architecture of AWS allowed efficient management of resources with cost cutting and operational overhead.
